Authoritative reference: [`FRAMEWORK_ROADMAP.md`](./FRAMEWORK_ROADMAP.md) § v1.2.

---

## TL;DR

Maxim's v1.0 user-facing surface buries the moat behind generic abstractions. 38 office-prefixed commands, 90 generic-named agents, catalog-dump help. A first-time user can't find the front door in 10 seconds.

**v1.2 fixes this with three coordinated changes:**

1. **Three-tier command surface** — VERB (intent, NEW) + OFFICE (role, current) + PERSONA (profession, NEW). Plain-English commands route invisibly to the right specialists.
2. **Agent roster expansion** — keep current office leads (improved DNA), add ~25 named specialists per moat. Office lead becomes router; specialist delivers depth.
3. **Comprehensive `/mxm-help` system** — auto-detects persona from `project-manifest.json`, returns persona-specific quick-start. Multi-mode catalog (commands / agents / frameworks / compliance / moat / getting-started).

**Effort: ~22–35 dev-days net new work**, on top of v1.2's already-scheduled 10 behavioral frameworks (~30–40 days). Total v1.2 = ~52–75 dev-days.

---

## Why this lands in v1.2 (not later)

- v1.1 ships license middleware + MOE + 7 compliance frameworks. Enterprise-readiness story.
- **v1.2 ships behavioral expansion + UX accessibility.** Adoption story.
- Without v1.2, every framework Maxim adds in v1.3+ stays buried for non-power-users. The marginal value of more frameworks is gated by surface accessibility.

Bundling decision (locked Session 14): no public-stability concern (only two testing users, both will update plugin before next session). The original v1.1.5-standalone proposal is dissolved; verb-first commands ship inside v1.2.

---

## The diagnosis — what's broken in v1.0

A first-time user opens their terminal, types `/maxim:`, sees 38 commands. Three problems compound:

### Problem 1 — Internal architecture is the user surface

Maxim's office model (CEO, CTO, CMO, CSO, CPO, COO, CINO) is meaningful to a founder building a SaaS. To a backend engineer who just wants to fix a bug, it's baffling. The user-facing command names (`/mxm-cto`, `/mxm-cso`) leak Maxim's internal org chart.

### Problem 2 — Commands describe roles, not intents

A user thinks "I want to build a feature." Not "I want to invoke the CTO office's implementer agent with TDD discipline." The verb-first surface is missing.

### Problem 3 — Discovery is a catalog dump

`/mxm-help` lists everything — 38 commands, 90 agents, 64 frameworks. Nothing curated. Nothing scenario-driven. The 10-second pitch never gets a chance to land.

### Compound effect

The behavioral-science layer, 90 agents, 64 frameworks — all genuinely valuable — never demonstrate value because the user can't find the front door. Maxim's moat is real but invisible.

## Three-tier command surface

```
TIER 1 — VERB (intent)         TIER 2 — OFFICE (role)        TIER 3 — PERSONA (profession)
─────────────────────          ──────────────────────         ─────────────────────────────
/mxm-build  <X>                /mxm-cto                       /mxm-legal     <X>
/mxm-fix    <X>                /mxm-cmo                       /mxm-arch      <X>
/mxm-ship   <X>                /mxm-cso                       /mxm-secure    <X>
/mxm-plan   <X>                /mxm-cpo                       /mxm-founder   <X>
/mxm-review <X>                /mxm-coo                       /mxm-pm        <X>
/mxm-explain <X>               /mxm-ceo                       (4 deferred to v1.2.x)
/mxm-help                      /mxm-cino
                               /mxm-route
                               + 24 specialist commands
```

### TIER 1 — Verb-first hero commands (intent matches dev workflow events)

| Command | User intent | Routes to | Behavioral overlay |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/mxm-build <X>` | "Build me a feature / module" | CTO (implementer) + CSO auto-loop on regulated data + CPO (UX) if frontend | Fogg B=MAP scope check; TDD discipline |
| `/mxm-fix <X>` | "Fix this bug / failing test" | CTO + tester + reviewer | Systematic Debugging; root-cause discipline |
| `/mxm-ship <X>` | "Cut a release / publish / deploy" | COO (planner) + CSO + reviewer + CMO (CHANGELOG) | Session-end bundle; SBOM check |
| `/mxm-plan <X>` | "Plan sprint / feature / migration" | COO (planner) + product-strategist + behavioral framework selector | Planning-with-Files; Coverage Matrix |
| `/mxm-review <X>` | "Review this code / PR / doc" | reviewer + CSO (if security-adjacent) + tester (if test code) | Framework citation requirement |
| `/mxm-explain <X>` | "Help me understand this" | smart-explorer + relevant office | Plain-language confidence tag |
| `/mxm-help` | "What can I do here?" | help skill — opinionated, scenario-driven | NOT a catalog dump |

### TIER 2 — Office commands (current, stays as-is)

`/mxm-cto`, `/mxm-cmo`, `/mxm-cso`, `/mxm-cpo`, `/mxm-coo`, `/mxm-ceo`, `/mxm-cino`, `/mxm-route`, plus 24 specialist commands. Power-user route. **No deprecation. Backward-compatible forever.**

### TIER 3 — Persona commands (NEW in v1.2 — the moat showcase)

Each TIER 3 command speaks the persona's vocabulary, surfaces moat moments specific to that profession, and routes to the right specialist agents invisibly.

---

## Agent roster expansion

### Decision (locked, Q2 corrected)

**Improve current generics + ADD specialists per moat.** Office leads stay (`enterprise-architect`, `implementer`, `reviewer`, `tester`, `planner`, `security-analyst`, `content-strategist`, `product-strategist`, `innovation-researcher`) — they get DEEPER DNA + a specialist roster underneath. Two-tier dispatch within each office: lead routes → specialist delivers.

### Pattern (applies to all 7 offices)

```
Office Lead (improved generic — high-level routing + cross-cutting concerns)
├── Specialist Group A (e.g., "Application Security")
│   ├── specialist-1
│   ├── specialist-2
│   └── specialist-3
├── Specialist Group B
│   └── ...
└── Specialist Group C
    └── ...
```

### Before/After by office

#### CSO Office (largest expansion — security is moat-central)

**Before (v1.0):**

```

└── horizon-scanner
```

8 agents.

### Roster total

| Office | v1.0 leads | v1.2 specialists | v1.2 total |
|---|---|---|---|
| CEO | 1 | 8 | 9 |
| CTO | 1 | 17 | 18 |
| CMO | 1 | 9 | 10 |
| CSO | 1 | 18 | 19 |
| CPO | 1 | 7 | 8 |
| COO | 1 | 7 | 8 |
| CINO | 1 | 7 | 8 |
| Orchestrators (executive-router etc.) | — | — | ~10 |
| **Total** | 7 | 73 | **~90** |

Today's count is 90 (after the cost-analyst + sre-analyst aria-simplification merge landed 2026-04-27). Net delta from here to v1.2 target is **0** — the v1.2 ~90 target is already met by count alone. v1.2 work is **renaming current generic agents into specific specialist slots + improving the leads' DNA**, not net-new agent files.

## Comprehensive `/mxm-help` system

`/mxm-help` is no longer a single command. It's a help SYSTEM with multiple modes.

### Modes

| Invocation | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `/mxm-help` (no arg) | Auto-detect persona from `project-manifest.json` → return persona-specific quick-start. Fall back to "what kind of work do you do?" wizard if detection inconclusive. |
| `/mxm-help <persona>` | Persona quick-start. Examples: `/mxm-help legal`, `/mxm-help arch`, `/mxm-help founder`. Returns 5–10 line opinionated intro + 3 hero commands for that persona. |
| `/mxm-help commands` | Full 3-tier command catalog with one-line description per command. Searchable. |
| `/mxm-help agents` | 90-agent roster grouped by office. Drill-down: each agent gets a one-line specialty + frameworks + collaborates_with snippet. |
| `/mxm-help frameworks` | 64+ framework catalog with trigger phrases. Links to FRAMEWORKS_MASTER.md. |
| `/mxm-help compliance` | Compliance map: which laws apply to YOUR project per `compliance.frameworks` in manifest. Shows status: in-scope / near-scope / out-of-scope. |
| `/mxm-help moat` | "What makes Maxim different" — opinionated differentiation pitch with examples. Same content the landing page leads with. |
| `/mxm-help getting-started` | 5-minute onboarding: configure manifest, run first command, interpret output, customize. |
| `/mxm-help frameworks <id>` | Framework deep-dive (Fogg, COM-B, EAST, OWASP LLM Top 10, etc.) |

### Default behavior — the killer onboarding moment

User runs `/mxm-help` with NO argument:

1. Read `config/project-manifest.json`
2. Apply persona-detection rules (see next section)
3. If high-confidence match → return persona quick-start
4. If ambiguous → run wizard: "I see you're working on a Next.js + Supabase project with GDPR + PIPEDA scope. Are you primarily a (1) developer (2) compliance lead (3) founder (4) other?"
5. Cache answer at `.mxm-skills/operator-persona.txt` for future sessions

---

## Auto-detect persona logic

Heuristics on `config/project-manifest.json`:

| Manifest signal | Likely persona |
|---|---|
| `compliance.frameworks` includes HIPAA, GDPR, PIPEDA, SOC2 + project type ≠ "compliance-platform" | Mixed dev + legal — offer both quick-starts |
| `project.type` = "compliance-platform" OR project mentions "DPIA / GRC / audit" | legal |
| `tech_stack.architecture.layers` ≥ 6 OR project has `documents/adr/` | arch |
| `tech_stack.security` has explicit `threat_model_path` OR `compliance.regulated_projects` ≠ empty | secure |
| `project.stage` includes "MVP", "pre-seed", "seed", "Series A" | founder |
| `project.type` includes "saas", "marketplace", "platform" + has `product` block | pm |
| Two or more match | run wizard once; cache result |

Persona cache: `.mxm-skills/operator-persona.txt` (single line: `legal` / `arch` / `secure` / `founder` / `pm`). Operator can edit. Session-end protocol re-checks if manifest changed substantially.

---

## Sequencing — v1.2 sprint plan

```
v1.2 sprint (Q4 2026, ~52–75 dev-days total)
│
├── Workstream 1 — TIER 1 verb-first commands (was v1.1.5)
│   • 7 verb-first commands implemented as router-frontends
│   • Plain-English /mxm-help banner
│   • Effort: ~5–8 days
│
├── Workstream 2 — TIER 3 persona commands (5 personas)
│   • /mxm-legal, /mxm-arch, /mxm-secure, /mxm-founder, /mxm-pm
│   • ~28 sub-commands total
│   • Each routes to specialist agents + frameworks
│   • Effort: ~8–10 days
│
├── Workstream 3 — Agent roster expansion
│   • Improve current 7 office leads (deeper DNA, better triggers)
│   • Add ~25 specialists per moat (CSO +18, CTO +17, etc.)
│   • Update agent-registry.json + AGENT_SKILL_INVENTORY.md
│   • Effort: ~5–8 days (mostly content authoring; structural work small)
│
├── Workstream 4 — Comprehensive /mxm-help system
│   • 9 modes (no-arg / persona / commands / agents / frameworks / compliance / moat / getting-started / framework-deep-dive)
│   • Auto-detect persona logic
│   • Persona cache at .mxm-skills/operator-persona.txt
│   • Effort: ~2–3 days
│
├── Workstream 5 — 10 behavioral frameworks (already scheduled)
│   • TTM, SDT, Dual Process, SCARF, TPB, Social Learning,
│     Operant Conditioning, Prospect Theory, Diffusion, Emotional Design
│   • Effort: ~30–40 days (per FRAMEWORK_ROADMAP)
│
└── Workstream 6 — Proactive Watch class 13 drift (already scheduled)
    • Detects framework non-adherence, tone drift, compliance violations in third-party plugin outputs
    • Extends MOE PostToolUse audit
    • Effort: ~3–5 days
```

**Suggested in-sprint ordering:**

1. Workstream 1 (verb-first commands) FIRST — gives testing customers feedback signal early
2. Workstream 4 (`/mxm-help`) SECOND — onboarding now coherent with new commands
3. Workstreams 2 + 3 (personas + roster) PARALLEL — both touch agent DNA
4. Workstreams 5 + 6 (behavioral frameworks + class 13) PARALLEL — independent of UX work

---

## Out of scope (this proposal)

Explicitly NOT in v1.2 — captured for future versions:

- **4 deferred personas** (researcher, devops, data, designer) → v1.2.x patches with full sub-command sketches preserved above
- **Agent agent-rename to fully break `enterprise-architect` / `implementer` / etc.** — rejected per Q2 correction. Generics stay improved; specialists added below them.
- **Voice mode** for personas — v2.0 candidate, not v1.2
- **Web UI for `/mxm-help`** — terminal-first remains the v1.x target
- **Cross-provider routing** — v2.0
- **Plugin SDK for cooperative integration** — v2.0

---

## Locked decisions (Session 14 close)

| Q | Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Launch v1.2 with 5 personas (legal, arch, secure, founder, pm); 4 deferred to v1.2.x patches (researcher, devops, data, designer) | Smaller surface = faster feedback; defer-with-sketches preserves option value |
| 2 | Improve current generic agents + ADD specialists per moat | Backward-compatible; office leads become routers, specialists deliver depth |
| 3 | Auto-detect persona from `project-manifest.json` + one-time wizard fallback | First-run onboarding becomes the killer moment |
| 4 | BUNDLE v1.1.5 + v1.2 (no public-stability concern; only 2 testing users) | Coherent narrative: v1.1 = enterprise-readiness, v1.2 = adoption story |
| 5 | `/mxm-help agents` shows drill-down by office with specialists named | The roster IS the moat — show it |
